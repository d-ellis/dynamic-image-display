# dynamic-photo-display

This repository was made to provide a method of replicating `grid-template-rows: masonry;` for image displays, without needing to use a specific browser or enable any flags.

## Browser compatibility

I have tested this myself manually on different browsers and my findings are below:

|Browser|Version|Works?|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Google Chrome|103|Yes|Built and tested for this browser.|
|Mozilla Firefox|101|Yes||
|Microsoft Edge|103|Yes||
